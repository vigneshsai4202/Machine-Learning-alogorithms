ðŸš€ 100 Days of Machine Learning

Welcome to my Machine Learning Journey! ðŸŽ¯

From today, I am committing to learn one machine learning algorithm per day and share my learnings here.
This repository will serve as my daily progress tracker, including:

ðŸ“˜ Algorithm Explanations â€“ Simple and clear notes for each algorithm.

ðŸ’» Code Implementations â€“ Python code for each algorithm (with comments).

ðŸ“Š Mini Projects â€“ Applying the algorithms on real-world datasets whenever possible.
