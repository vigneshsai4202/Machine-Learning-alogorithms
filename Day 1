Linear Algebra: Day 1 Notes (Machine Learning Foundations)
Welcome to the foundational concepts of Linear Algebra! This document summarizes key ideas from Jon Krohn's "What Linear Algebra Is — Topic 1 of Machine Learning Foundations" video.
1. What is Algebra?
• Algebra is essentially arithmetic that includes non-numerical entities, such as 'X'.
• Example: Solving 2x + 5 = 25 involves basic algebraic manipulation to find that x = 10.
2. What is Linear Algebra?
• Linear Algebra is defined as solving for unknowns within a system of linear equations.
• Key Characteristic: An equation is not linear if it contains an exponential term (e.g., 2x^2 + 5) or a square root (e.g., sqrt(2x) + 5), as these represent non-linear transformations.
• It focuses on multiple linear equations where you solve for unknowns (like 'X') simultaneously across several equations.
3. Practical Example: Sheriff and Bank Robber Problem
This classic problem illustrates solving a system of linear equations:
• Scenario: A sheriff (180 km/h) pursues a bank robber (150 km/h) who has a 5-minute head start.
• Goal: Determine when and where the sheriff catches the robber.
• Equations:
    ◦ Bank Robber: D = 2.5T (Distance = 2.5 km/min * Time in minutes)
    ◦ Sheriff: D = 3(T - 5) (Distance = 3 km/min * (Time in minutes - 5-minute head start penalty))
• Solution: By setting the equations equal (2.5T = 3(T - 5)), we find that T = 30 minutes and D = 75 kilometers. This is the "crossover point".
4. Possible Solutions in Linear Algebra
For a system of linear equations, there are only three possible outcomes:
1. One Solution: The lines (or planes in higher dimensions) intersect at a single point (e.g., the sheriff catches the robber).
2. No Solutions: The lines are parallel and never intersect (e.g., sheriff and robber travel at the same speed, but the robber has a head start).
3. Infinite Solutions: The lines overlap completely (e.g., sheriff and robber travel at the same speed and start at the exact same time).
• It is impossible for lines to cross multiple times in linear algebra.
5. Linear Algebra in Machine Learning
Linear algebra is fundamental to machine learning, often involving systems with many equations and unknowns.
A. Regression Models
• Predicting House Prices: A common example is predicting a house price (Y) based on multiple features (variables) like distance to school, number of bedrooms (X values).
• Model Equation: Y = A * X1 + B * X2 + ... + M * XM + Y-intercept
• Unknowns: The parameters (A, B, C, M) are the unknowns we solve for. These parameters are consistent across all rows (houses) in the dataset.
• Scale: Machine learning problems often have thousands of rows (N) (e.g., different houses) and dozens of features (M) (e.g., up to 12 columns for features).
B. Deep Learning Models
• Deep learning models can involve millions of rows (e.g., images in a machine vision model) and millions of parameters (columns).
• Inputs (X): For a machine vision model, inputs could be a vector of 784 pixels per image.
• Outputs (Y): These inputs are used to predict outcomes, which might be a vector of length 10.
• Internal Structures: Deep learning models involve weights (matrices) and biases (vectors), which are parameters tuned by algorithms to map inputs to predictions.
• Tensors: Linear algebra objects in machine learning are often represented as tensors, which can be multi-dimensional (e.g., 1D for vectors, 2D for matrices, or even higher dimensions for convolutional neural networks).
6. A Brief History of Algebra
• The term "Algebra" comes from the Arabic word "al-jabr," meaning "completion". This was found in the title of a book by Abu Jafar Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi (780-850 CE), a medieval Persian mathematician.
• Al-Khwarizmi is also the namesake of the word "algorithm".
• Significant early contributions to modern symbolic algebra came from the medieval Islamic Arab Empire, later refined by figures like René Descartes.
• Earlier forms of algebra existed:
    ◦ Rhetorical algebra (spoken) by Babylonians (1900 BC).
    ◦ Linear algebra by Egyptians (1650 BC).
    ◦ Linear equations by Indian mathematicians (6th century BC).
    ◦ Geometric algebra by Greeks (400 BC), exemplified by Euclid.
    ◦ Linear equations by Chinese (250 BC) in "9 Chapters on the Mathematical Art".
• European mathematics adopted and advanced algebra from the 12th century onwards, eventually becoming the dominant culture carrying its development.
7. Contemporary Applications of Linear Algebra
Linear algebra is crucial across many fields, especially in machine learning:
• Solving for Unknowns: A core application in all machine learning algorithms, including deep learning.
• Reducing Dimensionality: Techniques like Principal Components Analysis (PCA) use linear algebra to simplify high-dimensional data.
• Ranking Web Pages: Algorithms like PageRank use eigenvectors to determine the importance of web pages.
• Recommender Systems: Building recommendation engines (e.g., for movies) can use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
• Natural Language Processing (NLP): Used for modeling topics, semantic analysis, and processing both spoken and written language through techniques like matrix factorization.
