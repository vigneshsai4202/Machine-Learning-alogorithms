• Vectors Norms & Unit Vectors
    ◦ Previously introduced: vector norms (quantify magnitude) and unit vectors (special case with L2 norm equal to one).
• Basis Vectors
    ◦ A set of vectors that can be scaled to represent any vector in a given vector space.
    ◦ Typically, these are unit vectors along the axes of a vector space.
    ◦ Example (2D space): Vectors i (from (0,0) to (1,0)) and j (from (0,0) to (0,1)).
    ◦ These basis vectors (i and j) can be scaled and added to describe any vector in the 2D space (e.g., vector v at (1.5, 2) is 1.5i + 2j).
    ◦ Basis vectors are an example of orthonormal vectors.
• Orthogonal Vectors
    ◦ Sets of vectors where their dot product is zero.
    ◦ Assuming both vectors have non-zero lengths (non-zero norms), this means they are at a 90-degree angle to each other.
    ◦ In an n-dimensional space, there can be at most n mutually orthogonal vectors (assuming non-zero length). For example, in 2D, a maximum of two mutually orthogonal vectors.
• Orthonormal Vectors
    ◦ A special case of orthogonal vectors.
    ◦ They are both orthogonal (at a 90-degree angle) AND they all have a unit norm (a Euclidean distance length of one).
    ◦ Basis vectors are an example of orthonormal vectors because they are orthogonal and have unit norm

Matrices (Two-Dimensional Tensors)
    ◦ Matrices are two-dimensional arrays of numbers.
    ◦ They are a type of tensor, building on zero-dimensional scalars and one-dimensional vectors.
    ◦ A matrix is also referred to as a rank 2 tensor.
    ◦ Rank 0 is a scalar, rank 1 is a vector, and rank 2 is a matrix.
• Matrix Notation
    ◦ Matrices are denoted in uppercase, italic, and bold letters, for example, X. This contrasts with vectors, which are lowercase italic and bold.
    ◦ The dimensions of a matrix are noted with height (rows) prioritized before width (columns).
    ◦ For a matrix X with three rows and two columns, its shape is (3, 2), enclosed in round brackets.
    ◦ Individual scalar elements of a matrix are denoted in uppercase italics only (unbolded).

General Tensor Notation
    ◦ This generalizes notation for tensors with any number of dimensions.
    ◦ This includes high-dimensional tensors, which are common in machine learning models.
    ◦ Notation: Tensors are represented using uppercase bold italics and a sans-serif font.
        ▪ This contrasts with matrices, which use an uppercase bold italic serif font.
        ▪ "Sans-serif" means "without" the decorative extra bits on letter.

High-Dimensional Tensors (e.g., Rank 4 Tensors)
    ◦ A rank 4 tensor is a common input type for machine vision models, particularly in deep learning architectures.
    ◦ These four dimensions often represent:
        1. The number of images in a training batch (e.g., 32 images).
        2. The height of the image in pixels (e.g., 28 pixels for MNIST digits).
        3. The width of the image in pixels (e.g., 28 pixels for MNIST digits).
        4. The number of color channels.
            • Monochromatic (black and white) images, like MNIST digits, typically have one color channel.
            • Full-color images (RGB) typically require three color channels (red, green, blue).
    ◦ High-dimensional tensors can be created using libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow (e.g., a 4-tensor with dimensions 32, 28, 28, 3)
